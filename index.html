  <h3>Learning the Ropes</h3>
  <p>
    Although the first few days of CS 347 has been soley focused on html I am now inspired to learn even more about the
    capabilities experienced web developers have. This is what made me decide to learn more about javascript. 
    HTML is straight forward with how it works and its possibilities are limited in many ways.
    Javascript "adds interactivity to your website." When you think about the most pleasing
    websites today they are all dynamic and have eith smooth simple transitions or flashy stylish
    animations. Either way javascript is the programming language that allows this to happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Javascript is beginner friendly, which is good for me! The way variables and other "object" related
    things are different than the way I would normally think about them but things like operators are generally
    the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS is something else that has peaked my interest as I'm making my way through the journey of web dev.
    According the the article I read CSS can control "how HTML elements look in the browser."
    CSS is all about style and layout. The Syntax "rule-based" meaning you define rules for different elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was pretty basic information, but seeing as this is my first blog post I thought I would stick to the basics
    for now. I hope by the end of the semester I will be comfortable using HTML, Javascript, and CSS for my webpages.
