  <p>This weeks blog is driven by: (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics">developer.mozilla.org/javascript</a>).</p>

  <h3>Learning the Ropes</h3>
  <p>
    Although the first few days of CS 347 has been soley focused on html I am now inspired to learn even more about the
    capabilities experienced web developers have. This is what made me decide to learn more about javascript. 
    HTML is straight forward with how it works and its possibilities are limited in many ways.
    Javascript "adds interactivity to your website." When you think about the most pleasing
    websites today they are all dynamic and have eith smooth simple transitions or flashy stylish
    animations. Either way javascript is the programming language that allows this to happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Javascript is beginner friendly, which is good for me! The way variables and other "object" related
    things are different than the way I would normally think about them but things like operators are generally
    the same.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS is something else that has peaked my interest as I'm making my way through the journey of web dev.
    According the the article I read CSS can control "how HTML elements look in the browser."
    CSS is all about style and layout. The Syntax "rule-based" meaning you define rules for different elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was pretty basic information, but seeing as this is my first blog post I thought I would stick to the basics
    for now. I hope by the end of the semester I will be comfortable using HTML, Javascript, and CSS for my webpages.
  </p>
  <p>Here is an example of what some Javascript code looks like:</p>

  <h3>Website Builders</h3>
  <p>
    Square space is one of many website creators that allows users to make their own websites without having to code on their own. This is a very interesting subject to me since I am in the process of learning web development myself.
    I decided to read up on some reviews and how it works. Squarespace works by providing templates and styles to their users. It is a “drag-and-drop website builder” that allows you to build a website in sections at a time. 
    The website appears exactly how it looks in the website editor interface. The websites you can make are very clean and professional and once you get the hang of the editor anyone can create their own website. 
    The article I read says that Squarespace isn’t super user friendly but still is positively reviewed with a little time spent learning how to use it and stands up as a frontrunner in the space of website builders. 
    Website builders are very important in a world where everything is digital. Allowing people without coding knowledge to create websites on their own is a tremendous service to provide. 
    I believe that the biggest advantages are seen by small businesses and individuals wanting to promote themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Squarespace also provides a number of tutorials for beginner users. The tutorial I read about gave some information on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. 
    You can actually make changes to the underlying templates that exist on Squarespace customizing your website even more. 
    This is done through “Developer Mode.” I think this is where someone who does have experience in web development can leverage Squarespace to be an even more powerful tool.
  </p>
  <p>
    All in all I see tools like Squarespace as super signifigant to the world of web development. Providing access to many people who otherwise would not be able to create a space for themseleves online,
    more access is a good thing and I think everyone benefits from that.

    Here is an image of what a Squarespace Website can look like:

        <header class="flex_head">Online Payments and Payment Gateways</header>
        <article class ="main">
          <p>
            This weeks blog is about payment gateways and how online payemnt methods
            can be added to websites. The first article I read from justcoded.com teaches youwhat a payment gateway is 
            and how to implement one. The article says a payment gateway processes credit cards at online and offline stores.
            Basically all it is is "a tool to deal with all the financial transactions online."
            You need basic things like: Authorisation, Capturing the transaction, the actual Sale,
            the ability to Refund, and void transactions. These are simple steps and tasks that need to be implemented 
            in order to make a smooth payment gateway. There are also "Hosted payment gateways." These would include PayPal,
            Amazon Pay, Stripe, and others. These gateways take the customer away from your website to execute and complete a transaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next article I read was a post about the best payment gateways to use for small businesses.
            The first one they reccomend is "Authorize.net." It was founded in 1996 and has been able to integrate many features
            into it's services. They accept many types of payment options like: PayPal, Apple Pay, and Google Pay. The Pros they list 
            include "Strong Security and fraud prevention features", "Month-to-month billing with no long term contracts", and "Broad support
            for multiple payments and currencies." They go on to list a few more. But they wrap up their post with a section titled 
            "4 features to look for in a payment gatewat provider." The 4 features they list are: 
            "Support different payment types and currencies", "Security", "Early termination penalties and data portability", and
            "APIs and Developer tools." These are all super important for small businesses to integrate payment gateways because
            they make sure the business is getting exactly what they want and they're providing safe and useful gateways to customers.
