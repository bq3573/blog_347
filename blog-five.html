                    <h2>How would I teach CS347 in Spring 2022</h2>
                    <li>I think things would generally stay the same. The pace is just very fast but the flipped classroom still allows you to keep up with everything we worked on.</li>
                    <li>I think the idea for peer reviews were good but would have preferred feed back straight from the professor.</li>
                    <li>If there were in depth reading quizzes I feel like it would have made sure I was more on top of the readings.</li>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>How would I design my version of the course?</h2>
                    <li>I think I would make one homework due maybe every other week just following the textbook example code.</li>
                    <li>I dont think this class would do well with pure lecture classes but sometimes I felt like I really needed things slowed down and talked out.</li>
                    <li>Keep the same projects!!!</li>
                    <li>I'm not sure what the other option is but somehow I got charged $60 for digital ocean.</li>

                <div>
                    <h2>What would you have your students do?</h2>
                    <li>Make more assignments required outside of class, I think I got lazy at times.</li>
                    <li>I would maybe have certain checkpoints throughout the PA's</li>
                    <li>Muddiest Points required</li>

                <div>
                    <h2>What helped me learn the material of this course?</h2>
                    <li>I really thought the text book was really straight forward and helped a lot especially early on.</li>
                    <li>Flipped classroom really helped with hands on learning.</li>
                    <li>The projects were super interesting and allowed everyone to be creative which I think made things more fun and enjoyable.</li>
                </div> 
                <div>
                    <h2>What do I think would help the students learn?</h2>
                    <li>When we got to the more complex concepts I really would have liked some videos to refer to.</li>
                    <li>Just more assignments due or even more in depth grades to in class labs. I definitley let some things slide.</li>
                    <li>I think the idea for a pre req is a good idea because I knew nothing about webdev coming in.</li>
                    <li>There are also so many tools and utilities to use in web development. I'm sure they could be a whole class just learning those.</li>
